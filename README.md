# Hi there, I'm Dorien 👋

I'm a frontend engineer and open source contributor with a deep love for accessibility, community tech, and digital autonomy.

## 🌍 What I Do

- 🏳️‍🌈 Creator of [Queer Calendar](https://queer-kalendar.nl): an open source calendar for LGBTQIA+ events, built without Big Tech.
- 🧱 Platform developer at [Sculpture Network](https://sculpture-network.org): giving sculpture artists a digital home for their portfolios.
- 🧪 Prototype tinkerer: I build [Cities DAO](https://citiesdao.org) — exploring new ways of organizing cities.
- 🎓 Teacher @ [HvA]([https://www.hva.nl/](https://programma.fdnd.nl/)): I guide students in the Associate Degree Frontend Development & Design to build accessible, user-first, and progressive web platforms.
- 🤝 Volunteer @ [Share Network]([https://sharenetwork.eu](https://share-network.org/)): I teach frontend skills to refugees who are starting a new chapter in tech.
- ➕ Contributor to [Zotonic](https://github.com/zotonic/zotonic) - Open source CMS based on the Erlang language

## 💚 Values

I care deeply about:

- Accessibility by default
