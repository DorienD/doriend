# Hi there, I'm Dorien 👋

I'm a frontend engineer and open source contributor with a deep love for accessibility, community tech, and digital autonomy.

## 🌍 What I Do

- 🏳️‍🌈 Creator of [Queer Calendar](https://queer-kalendar.nl): an open source calendar for LGBTQIA+ events, built without Big Tech.
- 🧱 Platform developer at [Sculpture Network](https://sculpture-network.org): giving sculpture artists a digital home for their portfolios.
- 🧪 Prototype tinkerer: I helped build [citiesdao.org](https://citiesdao.org) — exploring new ways of organizing cities.
- 🎓 Teacher @ [HvA](https://www.hva.nl/): I guide students in the Associate Degree Frontend Development & Design to build accessible, user-first, and progressive web platforms.
- 🤝 Volunteer @ [Share Network](https://sharenetwork.eu): I teach frontend skills to refugees who are starting a new chapter in tech.

## 💚 Values

I care deeply about:

- Accessibility by default
- Open source collaboration
- Privacy friendly tools and platforms
- Designing large and complex content structures with clarity
- Teaching the next generation of webmakers with care and curiosity
- Empowering queer and marginalized communities through the web
